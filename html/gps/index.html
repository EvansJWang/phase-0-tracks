What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
Adds meaning to different sections of the website, useful for "accessibility reasons" like when a poor vision user has the website read aloud. Also for classification when using CSS.

Which ones do you see as most useful?
Nav - breaks the section down for links to other pages
Div - adds a in-line break
Section - Separates portions of the web page 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
Downloads the HTML document,
reads and executes elements top to bottom
parses the code that needs to gather information from other sources (i.e. other documents, links to websites, images from other websites) and downloads and renders them

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
Subl can create user input snippets to create shortcuts such as TAB TRIGGERS

Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Yes, based on the project I will be working on there might be constantly repeating text that simply needs a few variables of it changed. Could be so much easier and faster to create a snippet.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? 
Learning how to understand and implement new code and shortcuts for sublime. Without a guide it can be a lot of guess and checking without help to see what you are looking for and what might be the changes.

How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
Pairing with other individuals to see what they see. Helping share hypothesis on what a certain chunk of code will do opens my eyes to the different possibilities.
