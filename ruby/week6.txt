1. What are classes? Be sure to define the following terms in your explanation and describe the relationships between them:

class - Is a defined category of attributes and methods that behave a specific way
state - is the instance variables that define it within the class when first initialized
behavior - methods that alter or effect data within a class
instance variable - A specific creation of a class for example "words" is an instance of the class String

instance method - the initialization method that creates the basis for all instances of the class. This will determine which methods and attributes are available to all instances of that class. This will run whenever you create a new instance of that method


2. What are attributes?  These are the instance variables that you can call upon and can be either read,write or read and write based on the Class 

3. Give an example of a real world object, and describe how you might assign its attributes if you were to design a class to represent that object.

Dog toy
attributes: chewy, smell good to dogs, relatively indestructible


4. What is the purpose of the initialize method? When does it run? Initialize method defines all of the attributes and methods that come with any instance of that class. It runs whenever a new instance of the class is created

5. What are modules? Modules are groups of methods and classes that help with refactoring

6. What are the different ways you can use a module?
You can add multiple methods and classes to modules in order to share variables or prevent name clashes
