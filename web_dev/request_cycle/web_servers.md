In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
a Virtual private server is a chunk of memory on a remote computer that serves as it's own operating system that can host data. The advantages of a VPS is that it sections itself off from the rest of the computer's memory and acts completely independent. This way it allows you to fully explore the possibilities of the server and if there are malicious attacks on the server then it should not affect the rest of the memory. 


Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
The root user is similiar to the master branch on GIT. You should always use a feature branch or in this case utilize "users" when performing operations on Linux. Linux does not hold your hand. If you were to delete something or change a file and execute that line of code. It is done. There are security measures in place when a user is created and if you are on root, you are inherently the administrator and can damage/destroy OS files or something equally important.
